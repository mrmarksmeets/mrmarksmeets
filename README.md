- 👋 Hi, I’m @mrmarksmeets
- 👀 I’m interested in re-learning coding from what I used to know which was HTML, Cold Fusion, Access, SQL, Javascript, Visual Basic, Macros and expanding on it with Python, API's and EDI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - automating tasks in Excel via macros and eventually programming to help automate work tasks and help breakdown barriers for people/children with disabilities. If you're working in Logistics, I'm open to that as well as I've spent over 10 years in that industry (carriers and 3rd party logistics).
- 📫 How to reach me - use whatever the internal email is here for me.
